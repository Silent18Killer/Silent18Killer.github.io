# Contact Form Features

## Overview
The contact form has been updated with the following features:

### Form Fields
1. **First Name** - Mandatory field (marked with *)
2. **Middle Name** - Optional field
3. **Last Name** - Mandatory field (marked with *)
4. **Email Address** - Mandatory field (marked with *)
5. **Phone Number** - Mandatory field (marked with *)
6. **Subject** - Optional field
7. **Message** - Mandatory field (marked with *)

### Features
- ✅ **Real-time validation** with visual feedback
- ✅ **Mandatory field indicators** (red border for errors, green for valid)
- ✅ **Form data collection** with timestamp and user details
- ✅ **Success/error messages** with auto-hide functionality
- ✅ **Data storage** (localStorage for demo, server for production)
- ✅ **Email and phone validation**
- ✅ **Responsive design**

### Visual Indicators
- **Red border + shake animation**: Invalid/missing required fields
- **Green border**: Valid fields
- **Blue border**: Focused fields
- **Success message**: Green background when form is submitted successfully
- **Error message**: Red background when validation fails

## How It Works

### Frontend (Current Implementation)
1. User fills out the form
2. JavaScript validates each field in real-time
3. On submission, all data is collected and validated
4. Data is stored in localStorage (for demo purposes)
5. Success message is shown to user

### Backend (Production Setup)
1. Form data is sent to your server via POST request
2. Server validates and stores the data
3. Optional: Send email notification to admin
4. Return success/error response to frontend

## Data Collected
For each form submission, the system captures:
- Full name (first, middle, last)
- Email address
- Phone number
- Subject (if provided)
- Message content
- Timestamp
- IP address (on server)
- User agent (browser info)
- Referrer (where they came from)

## Setup for Production

### Option 1: Use the provided server example
1. Install Node.js
2. Run `npm init -y`
3. Run `npm install express cors`
4. Update the fetch URL in `script.js` to point to your server
5. Run `node server-example.js`

### Option 2: Use a form service
- **Formspree**: Add `action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID"` to the form
- **Netlify Forms**: Add `data-netlify="true"` to the form
- **Google Forms**: Use Google Forms and embed it

### Option 3: Custom backend
- PHP: Create a PHP script to handle form submission
- Python: Use Flask/Django to handle form data
- Any other backend technology of your choice

## Testing the Form

### Current Demo Mode
1. Open the website
2. Fill out the contact form
3. Submit the form
4. Check browser console to see the collected data
5. Check localStorage for stored submissions

### Production Mode
1. Set up your backend server
2. Update the fetch URL in `script.js`
3. Test form submission
4. Check your server logs/database for submissions

## Customization

### Styling
- Modify the CSS in `style.css` to change colors, animations, etc.
- The form uses CSS variables for easy theming

### Validation
- Update validation rules in `script.js`
- Add custom validation for specific fields

### Data Storage
- Modify the `storeSubmission()` function to send data to your preferred service
- Add email notifications, database storage, etc.

## Security Considerations
- Always validate data on both frontend and backend
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting to prevent spam
- Consider using CAPTCHA for additional protection
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks

## Browser Compatibility
- Works on all modern browsers
- Uses standard HTML5 form validation
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
